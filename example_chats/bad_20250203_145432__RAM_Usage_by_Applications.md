Agent: It seems that there is an issue with retrieving the data for the memory usage charts from your local Netdata instance. The API calls are returning a JSON Decode Error, which usually indicates a problem with connectivity or with the API endpoint itself.

To help you find which applications are using the most RAM, you may want to check the following:

1. **Netdata Service:** Ensure that the Netdata service is running on your local machine. You can do this by accessing `http://localhost:19999` in a web browser. If you see the Netdata dashboard, the service is running.

2. **Network Connectivity:** If you're using some firewall or security settings, ensure they are not blocking the API requests to the localhost.

3. **Check Chart Availability:** Double-check the list of available charts to ensure that they are still present in the system.

4. **API Access:** You can also try directly accessing the API from your browser or through `curl` command to see if the data can be retrieved outside of my interfacing.

If everything looks good and you're still facing issues, consider restarting the Netdata service and trying again. Let me know how it goes or if you need further assistance!
