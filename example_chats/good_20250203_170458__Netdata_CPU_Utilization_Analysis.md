# Welcome to the Netdata LLM Agent CLI!

- Type your query about Netdata (e.g., charts, alarms, metrics) and press Enter
- Type `/exit`, `/quit` or `/bye` to end the session
- Type `/save` to save the chat history to a file
- Type `/good` to save with good_ prefix, `/bad` to save with bad_ prefix (useful for debugging in langsmith)
- Type `/reset` to clear chat history and restart the agent

You: what percentage of cpu does netdata typically use on my local host?


──────────────────────────────────────────────────  

Agent: The CPU usage for the Netdata service on your local host is as follows:

- **Netdata Agent CPU Utilization (user + system)**: approximately **10.92%** each for user and system.

Here's the average CPU utilization across all CPUs:
- CPU 0: User: 6.21%, System: 9.32%
- CPU 1: User: 6.14%, System: 7.67%
- CPU 2: User: 7.29%, System: 11.67%
- CPU 3: User: 9.25%, System: 3.08%
- CPU 4: User: 10.97%, System: 10.97%
- CPU 5: User: 4.72%, System: 9.44%
- CPU 6: User: 9.33%, System: 4.66%
- CPU 7: User: 4.87%, System: 8.12%

This indicates that Netdata is using a total of approximately 21.84% of the CPU across your system when you consider both user and system time. 

Please let me know if you need further details or any other assistance!

You: wha chart did you pull this from?


──────────────────────────────────────────────────  

Agent: The CPU utilization data was pulled from the following charts:

1. **Chart: `app.Netdata_Agent_cpu_utilization`**
   - **Title**: Applications Groups CPU utilization (100% = 1 core)
   - **Units**: Percentage
   - **Dimensions**: User, System

2. **Chart: `system.cpu`**
   - **Title**: Total CPU Utilization
   - **Units**: Percentage
   - **Dimensions**: User, Privileged, Interrupts, DPC

These charts contain metrics related to CPU usage by the Netdata Agent as well as overall system CPU utilization. Let me know if you need any more information!

You: what is this in terms of the overall percentage of cpu cores on my localhost?


──────────────────────────────────────────────────  

Agent: To calculate the overall percentage of CPU usage relative to the total CPU cores on your local host, you would typically take the values from the CPU usage charts and aggregate them. 

1. **Understanding the chart metrics**:
   - The `app.Netdata_Agent_cpu_utilization` chart uses 100% to represent the utilization of one core.
   - The total percentages from other CPU metrics (e.g., `system.cpu`) are aggregates which can represent multiple cores.

2. **Calculating overall utilization**:
   - If you check how many cores are present on your CPU, this will help determine how much of the total CPU capacity is being utilized. For example, if you have 4 cores, 100% utilization would indicate that one core is fully tasked.

3. **Using Total Cores (example)**:
   - If your system has 8 CPU cores, 100% means fully utilizing one core, thus representing 12.5% of the total CPU capacity per core.

Let’s put this into a formula with an example.
Assume:
- **Total Cores**: 8
- **Netdata CPU Utilization**: 10.92% (each user/system) → total approximately 21.84%
   
You can calculate the total percentage in terms of core utilization:

\[
\text{Overall Utilization} = \left( \frac{\text{Total CPU Utilization}}{\text{Number of Cores}} \right) = \frac{21.84\%}{8} = 2.73\%
\]

This would mean that Netdata is utilizing approximately **2.73%** of your total CPU capacity as a whole across all cores.

Please provide the number of CPU cores if you’d like a specific calculation!

You: you can see number of cores from node info for localhost i think


──────────────────────────────────────────────────  

Agent: Your local host has a total of **8 CPU cores**. Given this, we can recalculate the overall CPU utilization based on the previously mentioned metrics:

### Total CPU Utilization:
- **Netdata CPU Utilization** (combined): approximately **21.84%**.

### Calculation of Overall CPU Utilization:
\[
\text{Overall CPU Utilization} = \frac{\text{Total CPU Utilization}}{\text{Number of Cores}} = \frac{21.84\%}{8} \approx 2.73\%
\]

Therefore, **Netdata** is utilizing approximately **2.73%** of your total CPU capacity across all 8 cores.
